In this project, we utilized data analysis and statistical processing to understand the electric response of semi-mobile zebrafish larvae in a microfluidic environment. The effects of several physical parameters including electric field direction, voltage magnitude, and repeated exposure to electric current pulses on zebrafish behavior were investigated.

# Methodology  <a name="data-overview"></a>

### 1. Data Collection:

Gathered data on zebrafish larvae' response to electric current direction, voltage magnitude, and repeated exposure in our proposed microfluidic device.
Extracted phenotypic parameters such as response duration (RD) and tail beat frequency (TBF).

### 2. Data Preprocessing:

Cleansed data to handle any outliers or errors.
Tested data for normality using the statistical test of D’Agostino-Pearson Omnibus.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed EDA to visualize the distribution of data using box plots and identified patterns in zebrafish response.
Evaluated the homogeneity of variances using Bartlett's test to inform subsequent statistical tests.

### 4. Statistical Analysis:

Relying on Bartlett's test outcome, conducted two-tailed student t-test with equal variances to determine significant differences in zebrafish responses upon exposure to different physical conditions (e.g., different electric field direction, voltage magnitude, etc.)

### 5. Power Analysis:

Utilized power analysis to determine sample sizes required for reliable results.

### 6. Correlation Analysis:

Investigated correlations between electric field parameters and zebrafish behavioral phenotypes.
Identified key features influencing zebrafish response.

### Electric Field Direction:

Confirmed zebrafish larvae's ability to sense and modulate their response based on the direction of the electric field.
Identified specific behavioral changes (RD and TBF) associated with different field directions.

### Voltage Magnitude:

Assessed the impact of voltage magnitude on zebrafish locomotion.
Determined voltage thresholds leading to changes in RD and TBF, indicating sensitivity to electric field strength.

### Habituation Analysis:

Explored the habituation patterns of zebrafish larvae to repeated electric stimuli.
Differentiated habituation from motor fatigue and sensory adaptation through recovery time and additional stimuli.
