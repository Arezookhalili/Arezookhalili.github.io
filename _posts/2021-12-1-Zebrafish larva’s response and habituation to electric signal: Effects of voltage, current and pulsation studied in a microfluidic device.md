# Methodology  <a name="data-overview"></a>

### 1. Data Acquisition:

Collected electrical resistance data from microplastic experiments conducted in the microfluidic sensor.
Recorded parameters such as flow rates, concentrations, and sizes of microplastics.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:

Cleansed data to handle outliers and inconsistencies.
Organized and structured data for effective analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering:

Extracted relevant features from raw data, including patterns in electrical resistance over time.
Explored relationships between features and microplastic characteristics.

### 4. Statistical Analysis:

Applied statistical tests to assess the significance of variations in electrical resistance.
Identified patterns in resistance changes corresponding to different microplastic concentrations and sizes.
